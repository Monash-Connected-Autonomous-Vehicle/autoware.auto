multi_object_tracking {#multi_object_tracking-package-design}
===========

This is the design document for the `multi_object_tracking` package.


# Purpose / Use cases
This is an algorithm package containing the MultiObjectTracker class.


# Design
See @ref tracking-architecture.


## Assumptions / Known limits
<!-- Required -->
TODO: Fill out as part of 870, currently still in iterative porting/development.

## Inputs / Outputs / API
It receives detected dynamic objects from multiple sources (e.g. lidar, camera), and outputs a result object containing tracked dynamic objects.


## Inner-workings / Algorithms
<!-- If applicable -->
TODO: Fill out as part of 870, currently still in iterative porting/development.


## Error detection and handling
<!-- Required -->
TODO: Fill out as part of 870, currently still in iterative porting/development.


# Security considerations
<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
- Spoofing (How do you check for and handle fake input?)
- Tampering (How do you check for and handle tampered input?)
- Repudiation (How are you affected by the actions of external actors?).
- Information Disclosure (Can data leak?).
- Denial of Service (How do you handle spamming?).
- Elevation of Privilege (Do you need to change permission levels during execution?) -->


# References / External links
<!-- Optional -->


# Future extensions / Unimplemented parts
TODO: Fill out as part of 870, currently still in iterative porting/development.
