# Autoware.Auto

## Autoware Core/Universe Migration

**We have migrated the development of Autoware to GitHub since 2022.**

Please check [here](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) to use latest Autoware.

You can find the new Autoware Documentation [here](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/).

To learn more about the transition, you can check [Past, Present and the Future of Autoware](https://www.autoware.org/post/past-present-and-the-future-of-autoware).

You can still make contributions to the Autoware.Auto project but MR's might take a while to be reviewed.

## Autoware.Auto

[Autoware](https://www.autoware.org/) is the world's first "all-in-one" open-source software for self-driving vehicles hosted under the Autoware Foundation.

The [Autoware.Auto project](https://www.autoware.auto/), based on [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/), is the next generation successor of the [Autoware.AI project](https://www.autoware.ai/), based on [ROS 1](http://wiki.ros.org/Documentation).

Please see [the documentation](https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/) for all information, including how to build, run, and contribute to Autoware.Auto.
